# Capstone
This project, comprises two main components: solvers for the Allen Cahn equation and options pricing models.
## Description
This repository contains implementations for solving the Allen Cahn equation using two different approaches, as well as models for pricing options using both theoretical and deep learning methods. The goal is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for financial analytics and numerical computation in the field of quantitative finance.
## Components
### Part 1: Allen Cahn Equation Solvers
1. **WDL Solver**: This solver uses Weighted Deep Learning (WDL) techniques to numerically solve the Allen Cahn equation, which is a well-known model in mathematical finance for capturing features of complex market dynamics.
  
2. **DRNN Solver**: Utilizing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN), this solver offers another approach to finding solutions to the Allen Cahn equation, highlighting the benefits of deep learning in continuous time models.

### Part 2: Options Pricing

1. **BS Model**: Implements the Black-Scholes model for options pricing, providing theoretical values for options based on the Black-Scholes formula, which is fundamental in financial theory for pricing European call and put options.

2. **DRNN Option Price**: This model uses a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) to price options by predicting asset prices. It demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning techniques to predict option prices under various market conditions.
